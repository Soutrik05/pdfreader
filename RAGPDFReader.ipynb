In FY 2023, \\nyour company delivered revenue of ₹225,458 crore, a growth of \\n17.6%. This growth has come at an industry-leading operating \\nmargin of 24.1%. \\nTCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable \\ntheir business transformation, helping them accelerate new \\ntechnology adoption and bring agility into execution. We work \\nwith large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a \\ndigital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of \\ndata and artificial intelligence (AI) and reimagine customer and \\nemployee experiences. \\nYour company delivered healthy client metrics enabled by \\nnew customer additions and deep client relationships. \\nIn FY 2023, growth has come from broad-based performance \\nacross markets and industry verticals. The order book continues \\nto be strong, indicating demand for your company’s services. \\nFrom a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over \\n614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates.\\nThe global environment is going through considerable changes. \\nGeopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and \\nUkraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have \\ncaused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the \\noverall economic environment. \\nAt the same time, the world is navigating several transitions. \\nUndoubtedly, these transitions will require significant \\ninvestments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge \\ngrowth opportunity for the IT industry.\\nThe global energy transition is accelerating. Businesses are \\nmaking clear commitments towards a sustainable future. \\nThere are many  innovations across products, services, \\nmanufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also \\nemerging. This requires investments in technology and \\ninnovation including electric mobility, renewable power, \\nhydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability \\ncompliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new \\nstandards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets \\nof this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be \\nan important enabler for businesses.\\nThe supply chain transition resulting from the geo-political \\nsituation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are \\nrebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency. \\nNew global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India \\nplaying an important role. This is being led by significant capital \\ninvestments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing \\nand supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem \\nintegration with partners.\\nIn the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital \\ntechnologies, bringing about a transformation across every \\nindustry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition \\na central focus. The impact of AI and Machine learning is going \\nto be profound. There is a transition already underway from \\npredictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are \\nstill adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing \\nlarge volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT. \\nThere are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors. \\nLeveraging generative AI would further require technology \\ninnovation and investments. \\nThere is another important area that companies need to focus \\non – building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain and \\nAI transitions are going to require companies to reskill/upskill \\nexisting talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest \\nin research. Our technology strengths make us well-placed to \\nrespond to the global demand and scale up our talent base. \\nAs the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also \\nassessing their approach to talent. Today, companies can tap \\ninto talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness \\nthe global talent pool effectively. Technology and tools are \\nfacilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models \\nof work. Harnessing this talent will need an approach that \\nleverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective \\nemployee engagement and collaboration. \\nYour company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities \\nwhich include products and platforms that are AI-powered. \\nOver the last few years, your company has leveraged \\npartnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous \\nsoftware-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along \\nwith IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation \\nopportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer. \\nWe will also invest in research areas important for the future, \\nin collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up \\necosystem. \\nI would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution \\nduring his tenure as CEO & MD and I wish him the very best for \\nthe future.

Our investments in \\nresearch and innovation across \\ndifferent industries, and our Pace \\ninnovation architecture have \\npositioned us well to partner with \\nthem in these initiatives. \\nApplied at scale, across a broad set of business or IT \\noperations, this can result in an entirely new operating \\nmodel that significantly boosts our clients’ competitiveness. \\nAs macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half \\nof the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their \\nspends and showing greater interest in such operating model \\ntransformations. \\nTCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, \\nhas been a game changer, enabling faster transformations \\nthat deliver concrete business benefits within months. Its 600 \\npre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions enable plug \\nand play transformation of a range of business and technology \\nfunctions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our clients have \\nused it to transform their business and IT operations. \\nIn traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-services \\nintegrated deals. By consolidating multiple elements of the \\noperation stack – processes, applications, and the underlying \\ntechnology and infrastructure – with a single strategic partner, \\nclients not only achieve greater accountability, but also reduce \\ncomplexity and derisk their larger business transformations. The \\nsame rationale is driving more vendor consolidation initiatives \\nthat favor a few strategic partners with end-to-end service \\nofferings, the right innovation capabilities and scale.\\nAll these trends play to our strengths. Our scale, structure, and \\nability to bring together different capabilities into a seamless \\nservice delivery team, helped us win several large deals \\nthroughout the year. \\nLetter to Shareholders  |  9'),\n",

This framework brings \\ntogether the best of TCS’ talent, research and innovation inputs, \\nglobal capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to scale up and \\nspeed up ‘Ideas to Outcomes’.\\nFor an insurance major, we worked with the client’s teams \\nand collated actionable innovation ideas through a series of \\nbrainstorming workshops using the Clay Map. Leveraging our \\nAIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got \\nturned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise. In just \\neight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24 \\nprogressed to become MVPs. \\nOne reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their \\ncontextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the \\nclient’s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply \\nrooted in that organization’s reality and therefore more likely to \\nsucceed. \\nHow does TCS help clients innovate, adapt and thrive?\\nGenerative AI is the talk of the season. What is the business \\nopportunity around it? \\nInnovation is about having a lightbulb moment. How do you \\nscale that?\\nKAK: Software that writes software has been around for a \\nlong time. In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS’ very first \\noffshore development project, delivered using an in-house \\ncode generator. In the 80s, our TRDDC  was famous for its \\ntools foundry, which could generate custom code translators \\non demand, converting source code from any programming \\nlanguage to any other language.\\nTCS MasterCraft™ is today used by hundreds of our clients \\nfor developing, transforming and maintaining model-based \\napplications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS \\nBaNCS™, is written and maintained using MasterCraft. Even \\nthough there is effort involved in defining the model up-front, \\nclients see significant productivity benefits. \\nThe new low code, no code platforms have done away even \\nwith those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user \\ninterface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build \\nsophisticated applications very quickly. \\nAnd yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has \\nonly led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no \\ndifferent. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply \\nbring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer \\nproductivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption, \\nwith volume growth more than making up for the effort \\ndeflation.\\nIf generative AI takes over coding, won’t the IT services \\nindustry become redundant?\\nrequire processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text, \\nimages and higher-level abstraction. \\nLegal and procurement teams can use it to trawl through \\ncontracts to identify specific clauses, or prepare a summary of \\nvariations of a particular clause. HR could use it for handling \\nemployee queries. Sales and customer service want smart \\nassistants that can explain product features and answer \\nquestions. In IT, generative AI can create basic code snippets or \\nquality check developed code for adherence to standards.\\nThese are just the initial ideas based on the standalone \\ncapabilities of generative AI. Over time, you will see newer use \\ncases that are more combinatorial, driving greater spending by \\nenterprises and expanding the opportunity significantly.\\nInnovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat  |  28'),\n",

A similar \\nmodel is powering start-up banks in Israel today. The insurance \\nHV: The evidence is empirical. Every new generation of \\ntechnology has led to reduction in programming effort per \\nfunction point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate \\nspending on IT services has only risen year after year, over \\ndecades.\\nTake for example, the switch from assembly language to C. \\nIts compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable \\npre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure \\nwith one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code \\nbase, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines \\nof C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The \\n10x effort deflation didn’t result in mass layoffs of programmers. \\nInstead, there was an explosion in software development \\nbecause the same IT team could now build ten times as many \\nfunction points. \\nSimilarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a \\nbig cost deflation, but nobody’s IT budgets deflated. Instead, \\nthose savings went into building new systems and volumes rose \\nto fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded. \\nLikewise with low-code, no-code platforms.\\nWhy is that so? Farm mechanization caused effort \\ndeflation and rendered the agricultural workforce \\nredundant in the West.\\nIndian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new \\ntechnologies. Will that change with generative AI?\\nWhat is the evidence for this thesis?\\nKAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any \\nincrease in volume is limited by how much of that good or \\nservice the market can consume in a defined period. When farm \\nmechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand \\nfor men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the \\neffort deflation because there was only so much land available \\nto till. \\nDemand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise, \\nthere is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited \\ncapacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement \\nbacklog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative \\nAI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and \\naccomplish much more with the same budget. But even then, \\nthe backlog never goes away because there is no limit on \\nbusiness users’ ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises \\nto fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies. \\nHV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas, \\nexperimentation and more demand for our services.

It has redefined urban landscapes \\nin Japan and around the world, with famous \\nlandmarks like Tokyo Tower and Changi International \\nAirport. At the core of its longstanding business success \\nis its passion for innovation rooted in its toryo spirit, \\nquality management, and its commitment to realizing a \\nsustainable society.\\n    \\nTakenaka’s Vision for 2030 aims to realize a fourth industrial \\nrevolution in the building industry by embracing digital \\ntransformation across the construction value chain.  It is \\naddressing key problems facing the industry in Japan, such \\nas labor shortage, by using digital technologies to increase \\nemployee productivity and improve the work-life balance of \\nemployees. Its innovation initiatives include AI-based design \\nand construction planning, next-generation work sites with \\nconstruction robots and remotely operated cranes, and \\nenvironmentally conscious smart buildings with \\nintelligent controls using IoT. The foundation for this \\ninnovation is the Building 4.0TM digital platform, which \\nis being developed and operated in partnership with TCS. \\nBuilding 4.0TM will integrate data from sales, design, estimation, \\nengineering, construction management, facilities management \\nservices, human resources and accounting. This will enable \\nsuperior decision-making across a wide range of operations \\nthrough advanced analysis using machine learning and AI. \\nIn building design, for example, structural engineers can use \\nAI-based cross-section estimations to more efficiently implement \\noptimal structural designs. In construction, it can enable better \\nconstruction planning using accurate forecasts of materials and \\npersonnel required to achieve target schedules, improve visibility \\nof project progress, and enhance labor productivity.\\nTCS is supporting Takenaka in promoting innovation, building \\nconstruction digital twins, simulating human behavior, utilizing \\nknowledge of the construction field, and exploring “what-if” \\nscenarios. The knowledge gained from these efforts will help \\nTakenaka develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions \\nthrough better designs, understand project risks, and improve \\nKPIs for quality, cost, schedule, safety, and the environment.\\nThrough Building 4.0TM, Takenaka will continue to create \\nnew value for society and customers while improving \\nbusiness efficiency.

This unprecedented \\nevent at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too, \\nand might want to pursue their dreams and aspirations just \\nlike anybody else. As for our track record in retaining senior \\nleadership talent, it remains industry-leading. \\nI am proud to say that almost the entire team of 25 business \\nheads we had created in 2008 is still in TCS. We have over \\n125,000 TCSers today with an average tenure of over 10 years \\nin TCS. This cohort represents the true strength of TCS. They \\nare the custodians of our culture, values and institutional \\nmemory, and have been central to our ability to weather the \\nunprecedented attrition and influx of fresh talent without letting \\nit affect the high quality of project outcomes that our clients \\nhave come to expect from TCS.\\nWe not only retained our leadership talent better, but also \\nexpanded the leadership pool six-fold in the last five years by \\nincubating a next generation of leaders running sub-ISUs, with \\nP&L responsibilities. The breadth and depth of our leadership \\nbench today makes our succession planning an industry \\nbenchmark, with multiple equally-qualified successors for any \\nleadership position, starting from the CEO down, as you recently \\nwitnessed.\\nSS: Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn’t call it \\na tailwind. We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from \\nbackfilling and retention expenses. If we onboarded a lateral hire \\nat a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee \\ncost is a recurring one. But yes, hopefuly we won’t have any new \\nheadwind due to attrition in FY 2024. \\nAlso, with the supplyside challenges easing, incremental \\ncost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an \\nopportunity to bring down subcontractor expense. That is one \\nimportant margin lever for FY 2024. Utilization improvement, \\nflatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are \\nthe other levers. On the other hand, we will have our usual wage \\nincrease in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel \\nexpenses during the year.\\nSS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily \\nmargin dilutive.

But in the medium and longer term, this \\nwill get adjusted. \\nWage inflation affects everybody in the market including the \\nclients themselves. Newer contracts reflect the changed cost \\nstructure for onsite effort. Also, contractual terms now peg \\nannual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates.  That \\nshould help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts.\\nSS: Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency \\ndepreciation. Rupee is also affected by India’s trade deficit, \\ninterest rate differentials and capital movements. But for \\nargument’s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit \\nof currency depreciation in the future. Now remember, the \\ncurrency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation \\nin India which historically, we never passed on to clients. In \\nthe changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new \\ncontracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been. So in the \\nlonger term, we should be able to sustain our current margins.\\nML: In my view, the productivity benefits will get baked into \\nclients’ expectations around project velocity and throughput. \\nFor a given project team size, clients will expect much higher \\noutput at a much faster pace, compared to today. On aggregate, \\nas the unit price of a function point falls, we expect volumes to \\nincrease. With ever-increasing dependence on technology for \\ncompetitive differentiation, we expect enterprise spending to \\nkeep growing, for which we will have to keep hiring new talent. \\nSo the linearity between revenue and headcount is not going \\naway any time soon.\\nSS: Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness. Based \\njust on the productivity improvements in code generation \\nusing generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which \\nis freely available to everyone – service providers as well as \\nclients’ IT teams – can change relative competitiveness and by \\nextension, margins. Margin improvement is possible from selling \\nhigher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use \\ngenerative AI. Likewise, new software products or platforms \\nwhich use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes. \\nWith laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you \\nmanage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile \\ndoing similar work?\\nWill sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your \\nmargins?\\nWithout the inflation differential, the Rupee may show greater \\nstrength than in the past. How will your margins sustain then?\\nFinally, a question on generative AI. Will the productivity gains \\ndelink revenue growth from headcount addition in the future? \\nCan we expect a higher margin as a consequence?  \\nML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for \\neverybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who \\nare well networked within the organization can work effectively \\nand even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up \\nover the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees. \\nWorkplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team-\\nbuilding suffered a lot in these two years. \\nThen there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our \\nworkforce today was hired after March 2020. New employees \\nget acculturated through physical interactions with senior \\ncolleagues and leaders, by observing and following their \\nbehaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, \\nemployee engagement as well as acculturation got badly \\nimpacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people \\nto our offices during the year.\\nWhy is Return to Office so important to TCS? Why not let \\nemployees continue to work from home?\\nML: Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or \\nlower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be \\nother reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home \\nduring the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for \\nsome women, keeping them from returning to office even after \\neverything normalized. \\nThe higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our \\nefforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down \\non it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel \\nare driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions \\nfulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up \\n23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for \\nonly 14% of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality \\nof the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as \\nthe supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting \\ndiversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1% \\nof our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce. \\nAttrition among women is higher than for men. Why? How are \\nyou addressing this?\\nsavings, or propose a completely different operating model \\nthat uses lesser effort, protects or even expands margins, and \\nachieves the client’s objectives. \\nTCS has differentiated itself in this space with the latter \\napproach. Its win-win propositions reimagine the customer’s \\noperating model, leveraging AI and machine learning to reduce \\nhuman intervention while improving process velocity and \\noperational resilience. Customers have really taken to this idea. \\nIn FY 2023, we signed 29 large operating model transformation \\ndeals, covering business as well as IT operations, compared to 18 \\nin the prior year. \\nOne, we are running a program called Elevate that empowers \\nemployees to take control of their careers and pursue their \\naspirations by achieving certain learning goals.

As a result, the global GDP is estimated to \\nhave grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus 5.9% in the \\nprior year1. \\nGlobal technology spending on Enterprise software and IT \\nservices crossed the $2 trillion2 mark in 2022, growing 5.5% YoY. \\nIT services grew 3.5% YoY, to $1,250 billion. This growth was led \\nby accelerated cloud adoption, preference for external expertise \\ndue to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of digital \\ntransformation to cover more back-office operational areas.\\nThe global IT services industry continues to be a highly \\nfragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid-\\nsingle digit market share.

Technological advancements and \\nbreakthroughs like generative AI and metaverse have opened up \\nnew vistas of both risks and opportunities.\\nTCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic business \\nenvironment very closely and has strengthened the deployment \\nof its Enterprise Risk Management framework to address \\nthe risks and leverage the associated opportunities. This \\nframework enables risk identification, risk assessment, risk \\nresponse planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk \\ngovernance.

The Internal Control – Integrated Framework \\n(the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency \\nand accountability in an organization’s process of designing \\nand implementing a system of internal control.

These have been designed to provide \\nreasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing \\nreliable financial and operational information, complying with \\napplicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, \\nexecuting transactions with proper authorization and ensuring \\ncompliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined \\ndelegation of power with authority limits for approving contracts \\nas well as expenditure.

In addition, \\nthe Company has adopted a Code of Conduct for its non-\\nexecutive directors which includes Code of Conduct for \\nIndependent Directors that suitably incorporates the duties \\nof independent directors as laid down in the Companies \\nAct, 2013 (“the Act”).\\n \\t\\nThe Company’s corporate governance philosophy has been \\nfurther strengthened through the Tata Business Excellence \\nModel, the TCS Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider \\nTrading and the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices \\n(“Insider Trading Code”).

None of the independent directors is related to each other, \\nor to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.\\nBoard effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds \\ndirectorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as \\nan independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.\\nTCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC \\nwhich emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse \\nand independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.\\nTCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures \\nand detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and \\nmaterial developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured \\nglobal investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the \\nmanagement or the Board.\\nShareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office \\nthrough a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ \\nRelationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.\\nAvoidance of conflict of \\ninterest3\\nChairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief \\nExecutive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD).\\nTCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses \\ncovering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any  \\nemployee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility, \\nwith or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval. \\nFor the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.\\nValues, Ethics and compliance6\\nOver the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and \\nhas earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global \\nbusiness. The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual, \\nExcellence, and Learning and Sharing.\\nThe TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate \\ncitizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, \\nprohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and \\navoidance of conflicts of interest.\\nEvery employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based \\nannual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, \\nfrequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values \\nand the TCoC.\\nCustomers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through \\ninclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.\\nEmployees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical \\nbehaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, \\nwhich are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department.

Succession \\nplanning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior \\nmanagement. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key \\nfunctions within their units.\\nSuccession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board.

To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised \\nthe Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the \\nGovernment of India’s eﬀorts to improve literacy. LaaS provides \\nan innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT \\nwith the theory of cognition and laws of perception. LaaS adopts \\ncreative means of delivery to enable functional literacy, such as \\nanimated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.\\nModules on the platform include functional literacy (8-10 \\nhours), digital literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness on key citizen \\nentitlements (3-4 hours), available in 12 languages – nine Indian, \\nand three foreign.\\nThus far, LaaS has successfully paved the way to self-reliance \\nfor over 1.13 million learners (~60% women) and more than \\n200,000 Preraks through literacy.\\nIn August 2022, TCS launched the ‘Each one Empowers one’ \\nportal which allows employees of TCS and Tata Group, along \\nwith their families, to empower non-literates in their local \\ncommunity, such as security guards, domestic workers and \\ngardeners.\\nThe program has generated transforming impact by promoting \\nsocial inclusion, ﬁnancial stability and economic growth.

Due \\nto limited local employment prospects, \\nvillagers from Alirajpur travel for work \\nto nearby Gujarat cities; Pyari is not an \\nexception in this regard. She never had the opportunity to \\nattend school, so she never achieved literacy. This became \\ndiﬃcult because she couldn’t keep track of her hard-earned \\ndaily income as a construction worker. \\nShe gained basic literacy skills after joining the Literacy as \\na Service (LaaS) program, which made her realize that her \\ncontractor used to defraud her by not paying her the proper \\nwages. LaaS gave her the awareness she needed to ﬁght for \\nher rights and ultimately get her dues. She can now calculate \\nher working hours and daily pay, create a budget, and save \\nmoney.\\nShe created a bank account and enrolled in Ayushman Bharat, \\na health insurance scheme, to obtain medical beneﬁts for \\nherself and her family. As a migrant who travels from her \\nvillage to distant work locations, she can now read and \\nrecognize train numbers to board the correct train.

In 2020, when she heard of BridgeIT she \\ngrabbed the opportunity to be part of the program. \\nGradually, she became a successful digital entrepreneur and is \\nnow providing several services such as photocopying, printing, \\ntaking and printing passport size photos, paying land taxes, \\nbooking railway tickets, Aadhaar, PAN Card and Ration card \\nservices, etc. Today, Priyanka not only runs a shop near her \\nresidence, she also has taken up the responsibility of another \\nshop at the Panchayat Bhawan of her village, employing two \\nother people from the village.\\nBridgeIT has inspired her to dream big and is successfully \\nsupporting Priyanka in achieving her plans for future. She says, \\n“My dream is to expand my business further and I want to keep \\nthe latest models of mobile phones and other accessories for \\nsale in my shop. Moreover, I also want to open a tent house \\nemploying more needy people in the business.

YEP provides employability training, imparting skills such \\nas business communication, aptitude, computer programming \\nand domain skills with the help of subject matter experts, \\ndomain leaders, and certiﬁed trainers from TCS. \\nThe program oﬀers participants a smooth transition from college \\nto careers, building their conﬁdence and enhancing their social \\nand economic status through its unique teach, coach, mentor, \\nand place model. It helps them navigate opportunities available \\nin the Indian job market with career guidance and mentoring, \\ntraining on interview skills and access to market-facing \\ncertiﬁcations and hands-on real-time project experience.\\nSince its inception, the program has:\\n•\\t\\nImproved the economic and social status of the \\nbeneﬁciaries and their families.\\n•\\t\\nEncouraged diversity and gender parity within the \\nworkforce while creating inclusion and access for \\nmarginalized groups across the country.\\n•\\t\\nIncreased the credibility and visibility of the training partner \\ninstitutions involved with YEP.\\n•\\t\\nEnabled access for corporates to season-agnostic, industry-\\nready talent.\\n•\\t\\nCreated speciﬁc career paths for students in hospitality, \\nbanking, retail and IT (which include cyber security, \\nnetworking, IT automation, Data Analytics, UX, SFDC to \\nname a few, etc.).\\nIn FY 2023, more than 31,000 students were trained across \\nIndia, of which 57% were women and 17% from the groups \\nqualifying for aﬃrmative action programs. Over 10,000 students \\nhave gained employment in the IT/ITES, banking, retail ﬁelds.\\nYEP Case Study\\nPreeti Diwakar was born and brought up \\nat Panipat in Haryana, and later her family \\nshifted to Kaushambi in Uttar Pradesh. Her \\nfather worked as a helper at local grocery \\nshops while her mother supported with \\nhousehold chores in neighborhood. Their \\nmeagre income barely put food on the table \\nfor the family of five. \\nPreeti had to fight hard in her pursuit \\nof education. She funded her own education by taking up \\ntuitions and borrowing course books from senior students \\nin school. While pursuing BCom at University of Allahabad, \\nshe discovered a strong desire to learn about the intricacies \\nof stock market, and later taught her classmates. But she \\nhad neither the funds to invest nor the conﬁdence to speak \\nabout it. She also lacked clarity on career goals or available job \\nprospects.\\nTCS Youth Employability Program brought a ray of sunshine \\nto her gloomy worldview. During the Covid years, Preeti not \\nonly learned math and reasoning skills, she also worked on her \\noverall personality. She learnt from her trainer, the importance \\nof public speaking, projecting conﬁdence in online interviews, \\nand active listening. In the TCS NQT exam later that year, she \\nscored 77.39% and got placed in December ’21.\\nShe launched a website and her ﬁrst YouTube channel \\n“Commerce Stocking” about stock market investment tips. In \\nDecember’22, she quit her job and became an entrepreneur, \\nlaunching her dream website for educating people on the \\nﬁnancial sector. In her own words, it was TCS’ YEP which \\nenabled her to ﬁnd her own voice and she has been following \\nit all along since then.'),\n",

Safety lead and lag indicators are measured across the organization and reported. The board-level \\nStakeholders’ Relationship Committee reviews the company’s health and safety performance on a half yearly basis. Over 94% \\nof the workforce is represented in joint management-employee health and safety committees that monitor, advise and drive \\noccupational, health and safety initiatives.\\n\\t\\nb.\\t\\nWhat are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the \\nentity55?\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nAs a part of its ISO 45001:2018 compliant Occupational Health and Safety Management System, TCS has a documented \\nprocedure to carry out assessment of work-related hazards and risks for all routine and non-routine activities carried out at \\nany location. Hazard and risk identification is carried out by the process owners in consultation with the safety experts. The \\nprocess owners are responsible to ensure adequate controls are identified and implemented to control the identified OHS \\nrisks. Mitigation plan and controls are provided to eliminate the identified hazards and risks. \\n\\t\\nc.\\t\\nWhether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. \\n(Y/N)56\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nYes. TCS has a safety incident reporting and management process to ensure that all work-related incidents (which include \\naccidents, near-misses, unsafe conditions and unsafe acts) are reported and closed after taking necessary corrective \\nactions. This is enabled through an online safety incident reporting tool which is accessible to all TCS employees to facilitate \\ntransparent reporting. The platform also supports incident investigation and corrective action with the perspective of \\neliminating hazards and preventing incidents. The awareness to employees on incident reporting is created during induction, \\nmandatory OHS web-based training (WBT) and communication through mailers during monthly theme on incident reporting. \\nThe action owners are also sensitized on the importance of taking corrective action within given timelines with the \\nperspective of eliminating hazards and ensuring mitigation plan is implemented\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nTCSers can also report their health and safety related issues or concerns through an internal administration helpdesk and \\nthese issues are resolved by the concerned action owner within prescribed timelines. They can also email their concerns to \\nthe Corporate HSE email ID and communicate with local health and safety teams.\\n\\t\\nd.\\t\\n Do the employees of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)57\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nYes. TCS recognizes that overall physical and mental wellbeing of its employees is integral to its success and growth \\naspirations. TCS has taken a holistic approach to well-being to cover mental health, ergonomic health, physical health, and \\nsafety at home, delivered through digital channels, hospital insurance services, occupational health services and through \\nseamless integration of all stakeholders. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nTCS has occupational health centers (OHC) at TCS facilities in India. The employees and contractors at these facilities have \\naccess to non-occupational medical and healthcare services as well. During the year, TCS facilitated several virtual specialist \\nconsultations with physiotherapists, gynecologists, nutritionists, gastroenterologists with whom employees can book pre-\\nscheduled appointments and avail the services. These consulting services have helped employees to a large extent during \\ntheir return to the offices after the pandemic. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nBeyond the OHCs, TCS provides comprehensive medical and healthcare services to employees through the company-funded \\nmedical insurance to employees and their dependents. In overseas geographies, non-occupational medical and healthcare \\nservices are provided as per the country regulations. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nTo enable physical fitness, TCS has recreational facilities and gymnasiums at many of its facilities; it organized yoga programs \\nsuch as online sessions, sun salutation challenge and personalized yoga training; continued to run the Fit4Life program with \\ndaily workout sessions, walking and running challenges.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nMental well being: TCS, through its TCS Cares initiative, instituted programs for employees and their families to help \\ncope with the mental stress and anxiety. Online counselling sessions and self-help resources help employees facing high \\ndistress levels through empathetic support by HR, managers, and peers. Emotional well-being (EWB) leaves are available \\nto employees who need it. With many employees returning to work during the year, ‘Return to office’ transition program \\nincluded multiple training and sensitization programs for HRs, managers and employees. TCS Cares mental health wellness \\nweb-based training (WBT) was completed by many employees during the year. Also, several leaders completed the Cares \\nLeadership Program.

If Yes, then provide details83.\\n\\t\\nYes. TCS had set a target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030. \\nThe first part was achieved in FY 2023 through a combination of green infrastructure, green IT, energy efficiency and renewable \\nenergy. \\n\\t\\nCommitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\\n\\t\\nIn June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero \\nthrough the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking \\naction - Science Based Targets. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.\\n\\t\\nGreen Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:\\n\\t\\nAll new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have \\nroof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. Currently, 36 TCS offices, with over 23.68 million sq. ft \\nof office area, are certified green buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These make up over 64.6% of TCS’ total real \\nestate portfolio in India.\\n\\t\\nDuring the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT \\ninfrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply \\n(UPS), LEDs, motors, and chillers. \\n\\t\\n•\\t\\nHVAC system upgradation included deployment of energy efficient fans for Air handling units (AHUs), Variable Refrigerant \\nFlow (VRF) systems for 24X7 on variable load, oilless centrifugal chillers like magnetic or ceramic bearing chillers and chiller \\nplant manager. \\n\\t\\n•\\t\\nEnergy efficient UPS included Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based UPS with high efficiency and modular UPS.\\n\\t\\n•\\t\\nOther energy efficiency initiatives included LED lighting with advanced controls, EFF1/IE3 rated high efficiency motors, 11KV \\npower distribution from sub-station to different buildings, use of 11 kV centrifugal chillers and elevators with energy efficient \\nand gearless motors. \\n81\\t\\nThere are some inclusions and modifications in estimating carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY 2022.  \\n\\t\\n\\x07Scope 2 emissions: The emission factors for the grid electricity across various geographies have been taken primarily from IEA v5-IEA 2022 \\n(12/2022) database except for US, Canada, Australia, and India where emission factors are available from regional sources. For India geography, \\nthe Central Electricity Authority (CEA), user guide 18.0, Dec 2022 emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh (carbon emission factor of grid \\nelectricity, including RE) has been considered for estimating the carbon emissions from procured electricity in FY 2023. Over the years CEA has \\nbeen publishing the weighted average carbon emission factor (conventional) of the grid which was being used by TCS for Scope 2 emissions \\nuntil FY 2022 as emission factors (including RE) was not available earlier. However, in Dec 2022, CEA published the carbon emission factor of \\ngrid electricity (including RE) for the first time for years 2013-14 to 2021-22. As TCS procures electricity from the India grid, which is mix of \\nconventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate.\\n82\\t\\nCorrected Scope 1 emissions data for FY 2022 due to minor changes in fuel consumption data. \\n83\\t\\nGRI 305-5, TC-SI-130a.3.

Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated. In view of adopting \\nupdated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%. \\n•\\t\\n\\x07Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned \\nvehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in \\nFY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total \\nemissions under category 3.\\n•\\t\\n\\x07Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to \\nother supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal. The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen \\nsupplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous \\nwastes, batteries etc.,). Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. The increase in \\nscope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4.\\n•\\t\\n\\x07Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2023. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of \\nwaste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022. \\n•\\t\\n\\x07Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at \\nvarious geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022. The increase in scope of reporting contributes \\nto 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6.\\n•\\t\\n\\x07Category 7: In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees \\n(global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global). In pre-\\npandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021 \\nand FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category. The occupancy in overseas offices has been minimum during FY 2023 due \\nto majority of the associates working from home and therefore considered insignificant, and not included in the emissions.'),\n",

We conducted our audit in accordance with the \\nGuidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an \\naudit of internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require \\nthat we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform \\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nadequate internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements were established and maintained and if such controls \\noperated effectively in all material respects.\\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \\nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls \\nAnnexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023\\nwith reference to financial statements and their operating \\neffectiveness.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to financial statements to \\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree \\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nFor B S R & Co.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of \\nthe consideration given in exchange for goods and services. \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an \\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. All \\nassets and liabilities have been classified as current and \\nnon-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle. \\nBased on the nature of services rendered to customers \\nand time elapsed between deployment of resources \\nand the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the \\nconsideration for such services rendered, the Group has \\nconsidered an operating cycle of 12 months.\\n\\t\\nThe statement of cash flows has been prepared under \\nindirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the \\neffects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals \\nor accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or \\npayments and items of income or expense associated \\nwith investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows \\nfrom operating, investing and financing activities of the \\nGroup are segregated.

Revisions to accounting estimates are \\nrecognised in the period in which the estimates are revised \\nand future periods are affected.\\n\\t\\nThe Group uses the following critical accounting estimates \\nin preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\\n\\t\\n(a)\\t Revenue recognition\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nRevenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using \\npercentage-of-completion method. The Group uses \\njudgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion \\nof the contracts which is used to determine degree of \\ncompletion of the performance obligation.\\n\\t\\n(b)\\t Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group reviews the useful life of property, \\nplant and equipment at the end of each reporting \\nperiod. This reassessment may result in change in \\ndepreciation expense in future periods.\\n\\t\\n(c)\\t Impairment of goodwill\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash \\ngenerating units (CGUs) based on the future cash \\nflows after considering current economic conditions \\nand trends, estimated future operating results and \\ngrowth rate and anticipated future economic and \\nregulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are \\ndeveloped using internal forecasts. The discount rates \\nused for the CGUs represent the weighted average \\ncost of capital based on the historical market returns \\nof comparable companies.\\n\\t\\n(d)\\t Fair value measurement of financial instruments\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial \\nliabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be \\nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, \\ntheir fair value is measured using valuation techniques \\nincluding the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs \\nto these models are taken from observable markets \\nwhere possible, but where this is not feasible, a \\ndegree of judgement is required in establishing fair \\nvalues. Judgements include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \\nin assumptions about these factors could affect the \\nreported fair value of financial instruments.\\n\\t\\n(e)\\t Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group uses estimates and judgements based \\non the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of \\nrevenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is \\nexercised while determining the provision for income \\ntax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent \\nthat it is probable that future taxable profit will be \\navailable against which the deductible temporary \\ndifferences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, \\nthe Group exercises its judgement to reassess the \\ncarrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of \\neach reporting period.\\n\\t\\n(f)\\t\\nProvisions and contingent liabilities\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group estimates the provisions that have present \\nobligations as a result of past events and it is probable \\nthat outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end \\nof each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect \\nthe current best estimates.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group uses significant judgements to assess \\ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are \\nrecognised when there is a possible obligation arising \\nfrom past events, the existence of which will be \\nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence \\nof one or more uncertain future events not wholly \\nwithin the control of the Group or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources will be required \\nto settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the \\namount cannot be made. Contingent assets are \\nneither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\n\\t\\n(g)\\t Employee benefits\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe accounting of employee benefit plans in the \\nnature of defined benefit requires the Group to use \\nassumptions. These assumptions have been explained \\nunder employee benefits note.\\n\\t\\n(h)\\t Leases\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to \\nbe a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. \\nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement. \\nThe Group uses significant judgement in assessing the \\nlease term (including anticipated renewals) and the \\napplicable discount rate.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-\\ncancellable period of a lease, together with both \\nperiods covered by an option to extend the lease'),\n",

On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the \\nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment \\nRules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:\\n\\t\\nInd AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements\\n\\t\\nThe amendments require companies to disclose their \\nmaterial accounting policies rather than their significant \\naccounting policies. Accounting policy information, \\ntogether with other information, is material when it can \\nreasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary \\nusers of general purpose financial statements. The Group \\ndoes not expect this amendment to have any significant \\nimpact in its financial statements.\\n\\t\\nInd AS 12 – Income Taxes\\n\\t\\nThe amendments clarify how companies account \\nfor deferred tax on transactions such as leases and \\ndecommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed \\nthe scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 \\nand 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no \\nlonger applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, \\ngive rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary \\ndifferences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its \\nfinancial statements.\\n\\t\\n\\x07Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting \\nEstimates and Errors\\n\\t\\nThe amendments will help entities to distinguish between \\naccounting policies and accounting estimates. The \\ndefinition of a change in accounting estimates has been \\nreplaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under \\nthe new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary \\namounts in financial statements that are subject to \\nmeasurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting \\nestimates if accounting policies require items in financial \\nstatements to be measured in a way that involves \\nmeasurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this \\namendment to have any significant impact in its financial \\nstatements.\\n7)\\t\\nBusiness combinations\\n\\t\\nThe Group accounts for its business combinations under \\nacquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs \\nare recognised in the consolidated statement of profit \\nand loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, \\nliabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition \\nfor recognition are recognised at their fair values at the \\nacquisition date.\\n\\t\\nPurchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value \\nof net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where \\nthe fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed \\nthe cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values \\nof the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is \\nrecognised as capital reserve.\\n\\t\\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially \\nmeasured either at fair value or at the non-controlling \\ninterests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable \\nnet assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an \\nacquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, \\nthe carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the \\namount of those interests at initial recognition plus the \\nnon-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in \\nequity of subsidiaries.\\n\\t\\nBusiness combinations arising from transfers of interests in \\nentities that are under common control are accounted at \\nhistorical cost. The difference between any consideration \\ngiven and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of \\nassets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in \\nshareholders’ equity.\\n8)\\t\\n\\x07Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity \\ninstruments\\n\\t\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised when the \\nGroup becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \\nthe instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially \\nmeasured at fair value, except for trade receivables which \\nare initially measured at transaction price. Transaction \\ncosts that are directly attributable to the acquisition or \\nissue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than \\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through \\nprofit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair \\nvalue measured on initial recognition of financial asset or \\nfinancial liability.\\n\\t\\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset only when the \\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, \\nor when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all \\nthe risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another \\nentity.

The right-of-use asset is \\nsubsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted \\nfor any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the \\ncommencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use \\nassets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment \\nwhenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss.\\n\\t\\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \\ndate of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily \\ndetermined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably \\nsimilar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease \\nor the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease \\npayments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that \\noption and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate \\nthe lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease \\nliability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any \\nreassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount \\nof the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit \\nand loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero \\nand there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-\\nmeasurement in statement of profit and loss.\\n\\t\\nThe Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease \\nterm of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these \\nleases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n\\t\\nGroup as a lessor\\n\\t\\nAt the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group \\nrecognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a \\nfinance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on \\nthe lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease \\nand the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from \\nthe head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the \\nexemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\\n\\t\\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with \\ncustomers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\\n\\t\\nThe details of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions for  \\nthe year ended \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nNet carrying  \\namount as at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nLeasehold land\\n 179 \\n 940 \\nBuildings\\n 1,236 \\n 6,330 \\nLeasehold improvements\\n 14 \\n 30 \\nComputer equipment\\n 73 \\n 125 \\nSoftware licences\\n - \\n 96 \\nVehicles\\n 17 \\n 34 \\nOffice equipment\\n 1 \\n 5 \\n 1,520 \\n 7,560'),\n",

The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable \\nconsideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and \\nincentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant \\nfinancing component.

The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction \\nprice only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will \\nnot occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.

Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\\n\\t\\nIn accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the \\nobligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\\n\\t\\nContracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews \\nmodification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new \\nperformance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change.

These responsibilities include the \\ndesign, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal \\nfinancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring \\nthe orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including \\nadherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, \\nthe prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy \\nand completeness of the accounting records, and the timely \\npreparation of reliable financial information, as required under \\nthe Act.\\nAuditors’ Responsibility\\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s \\ninternal financial controls with reference to financial statements \\nbased on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with \\nthe Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an \\naudit of internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require \\nthat we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform \\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nadequate internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements were established and maintained and if such controls \\noperated effectively in all material respects.\\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \\nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls \\nwith reference to financial statements and their operating \\neffectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with \\nreference to financial statements included obtaining an \\nunderstanding of internal financial controls with reference to \\nfinancial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness \\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating \\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. \\nThe procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, \\nincluding the assessment of the risks of material misstatement \\nof the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or \\nerror.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit \\nopinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with \\nreference to financial statements.\\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to \\nFinancial Statements\\nA company’s internal financial controls with reference to \\nfinancial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable \\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting \\nand the preparation of standalone financial statements for \\nexternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to financial statements to \\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree \\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nFor B S R & Co.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of \\nthe consideration given in exchange for goods and services. \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an \\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. \\nAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current and \\nnon-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. \\nBased on the nature of services rendered to customers \\nand time elapsed between deployment of resources \\nand the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the \\nconsideration for such services rendered, the Company has \\nconsidered an operating cycle of 12 months.\\n\\t\\nThe statement of cash flows has been prepared under \\nindirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the \\neffects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals \\nor accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or \\npayments and items of income or expense associated \\nwith investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from \\noperating, investing and financing activities of the Company \\nare segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid \\ninvestments that are readily convertible to known amounts \\nof cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in \\nvalue to be cash equivalents.\\n\\t\\nThese standalone financial statements have been prepared \\nin Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the \\nCompany. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at \\nexchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. \\nForeign currency denominated monetary assets and \\nliabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing \\non the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses \\narising on settlement and restatement are recognised in \\nthe statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and \\nliabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in \\nforeign currencies are not retranslated.\\n\\t\\nThe significant accounting policies used in preparation of \\nthe standalone financial statements have been discussed in \\nthe respective notes.\\n4)\\t\\nUse of estimates and judgements\\t\\n\\t\\nThe preparation of standalone financial statements \\nin conformity with the recognition and measurement \\nprinciples of Ind AS requires management of the Company \\nto make estimates and judgements that affect the reported \\nbalances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent \\nliabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements \\nand the reported amounts of income and expenses for the \\nperiods presented.\\n\\t\\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \\nan ongoing basis.

The inputs to these \\nmodels are taken from observable markets where possible, \\nbut where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is \\nrequired in establishing fair values. Judgements include \\nconsiderations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and \\nvolatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could \\naffect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\\n(e)\\t Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\\n\\t\\nThe Company uses estimates and judgements based on \\nthe relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, \\ncosts, allowances and disallowances which is exercised \\nwhile determining the provision for income tax. A deferred \\ntax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that \\nfuture taxable profit will be available against which the \\ndeductible temporary differences and tax losses can be \\nutilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement \\nto reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at \\nthe end of each reporting period.\\n(f)\\t\\nProvisions and contingent liabilities\\n\\t\\nThe Company estimates the provisions that have present \\nobligations as a result of past events and it is probable \\nthat outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end \\nof each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the \\ncurrent best estimates.\\n\\t\\nThe Company uses significant judgements to assess \\ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised \\nwhen there is a possible obligation arising from past events, \\nthe existence of which will be confirmed only by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain \\nfuture events not wholly within the control of the Company \\nor a present obligation that arises from past events where \\nit is either not probable that an outflow of resources will \\nbe required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate \\nof the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are \\nneither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial \\nstatements.\\n(g)\\t Employee benefits\\n\\t\\nThe accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of \\ndefined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. \\nThese assumptions have been explained under employee \\nbenefits note.\\n(h)\\t Leases\\n\\t\\nThe Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a \\nlease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification \\nof a lease requires significant judgement. The Company \\nuses significant judgement in assessing the lease term \\n(including anticipated renewals) and the applicable \\ndiscount rate.\\n\\t\\nThe Company determines the lease term as the non-\\ncancellable period of a lease, together with both periods \\ncovered by an option to extend the lease if the Company \\nis reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods \\ncovered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company \\nis reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In \\nassessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to \\nexercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an \\noption to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts \\nand circumstances that create an economic incentive for \\nthe Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, \\nor not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The \\nCompany revises the lease term if there is a change in the \\nnon-cancellable period of a lease.\\n\\t\\nThe discount rate is generally based on the incremental \\nborrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a \\nportfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\\n5)\\t\\nRecent pronouncements\\n\\t\\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard \\nor amendments to the existing standards under Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to \\ntime. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the \\nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment \\nRules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:\\n\\t\\nInd AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements\\n\\t\\nThe amendments require companies to disclose their \\nmaterial accounting policies rather than their significant \\naccounting policies. Accounting policy information, \\ntogether with other information, is material when it can \\nreasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary \\nusers of general purpose financial statements. The \\nCompany does not expect this amendment to have any \\nsignificant impact in its financial statements.\\n\\t\\nInd AS 12 – Income Taxes\\n\\t\\nThe amendments clarify how companies account \\nfor deferred tax on transactions such as leases and \\ndecommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed \\nthe scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 \\nand 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no \\nlonger applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, \\ngive rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary \\ndifferences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in \\nits financial statements.\\n\\t\\n\\x07Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting \\nEstimates and Errors\\n\\t\\nThe amendments will help entities to distinguish between \\naccounting policies and accounting estimates.

The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial \\nmeasurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease \\nincentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling \\nand removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is \\nsubsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted \\nfor any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the \\ncommencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use \\nassets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment \\nwhenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss.\\n\\t\\nThe Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \\ndate of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily \\ndetermined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably \\nsimilar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the \\nlease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable \\nlease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to \\nexercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option \\nto terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the \\nlease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect \\nany reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the \\namount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of \\nprofit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero \\nand there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the \\nre-measurement in statement of profit and loss.\\n\\t\\nThe Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease \\nterm of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these \\nleases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n\\t\\nCompany as a lessor\\t\\n\\t\\nAt the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The \\nCompany recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In \\ncase of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate \\nof return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in \\nthe head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use \\nasset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the \\nCompany applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. \\n\\t\\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with \\ncustomers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\\n\\t\\nThe details of the right-of-use assets held by the Company is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions for  \\nthe year ended \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nNet carrying  \\namount as at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nLeasehold land\\n 179 \\n 940 \\nBuildings\\n 799 \\n 4,608 \\nLeasehold improvement\\n - \\n 2 \\nComputer equipment\\n - \\n 49 \\nSoftware licences\\n - \\n 96 \\nVehicles\\n - \\n-*\\n 978 \\n 5,695 \\n\\t\\n*Represents value less than `0.50 crore.'),\n",

The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable \\nconsideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and \\nincentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant \\nfinancing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for \\na distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction \\nprice only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will \\nnot occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations \\nto all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct \\nperformance obligations.\\n\\t\\nThe Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a \\nperiod of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who \\ncontrols the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of \\nsuch product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\\n\\t\\nRevenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.\\n\\t\\nContract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for \\ncapitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of \\nthis criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be \\nused to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\\n\\t\\nContract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified \\nas unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of \\ntime is required, as per contractual terms.\\n\\t\\nUnearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\\n\\t\\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress \\npayments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\\n\\t\\nIn accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the \\nobligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\\n\\t\\nContracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews \\nmodification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new \\nperformance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is \\nrevised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\\n\\t\\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.\\n\\t\\nRevenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2022\\nConsultancy services\\n1,88,748\\n1,59,106\\nSale of equipment and software licences\\n 1,606 \\n 1,235 \\n1,90,354\\n1,60,341'),\n",
